        <p>The way in which arts and culture is consumed today is very different from ten years ago and still ten years before that. Of course, it’s easy to see that in ten years, it will be even more different. Technology will continue to change how art and culture is consumed in many unpredictable ways. However, Michael Kaiser “the turnaround king” for arts organizations states while describing his book, Curtains? The Future of the Arts in America, "We are at the beginning of a major change in the way people receive their arts, and I believe online will become the source and a major competitor to live arts," he says. "And it appears to me that we will see a bifurcation of arts organizations, with the large ones, who will make revenue based on selling performances online, and local organizations who service the community.

One popular phenomenon that has been popping up lately is the performance of live musicals broadcasted on TV. NBC aired ‘Peter Pan Live!’ just last week after performing ‘Sound of Music’ last year. After the broadcast, they announced their plans for ‘The Music Man’ next year. In response to this, rival network FOX announced their plans to broadcast ‘Grease’ sometime next year. With 9.1 million viewers for this event, it is clear to see that this is a trend that emerging arts leader need to be aware of because it shows a whole shift in the way in which arts and culture are consumed...<a href="http://fieldsm9.github.io/portfolio/post001.pdf">Read More</a>.</p>
